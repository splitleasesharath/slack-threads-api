## Required OAuth Scopes

### Minimum for Text/Threads:
- `chat:write`

### Additional for Images:
- `files:write`
- `files:read`

### Optional:
- `channels:read`
- `users:read`

## Important Notes

1. **Token Updates**: After adding new OAuth scopes, you MUST:
   - Reinstall the app to workspace
   - Copy the NEW token (it changes!)
   - Update .env with new token

2. **Image Upload Requirements**:
   - Both `files:write` AND `files:read` are required
   - The SDK's `files_upload_v2` internally calls `files.info`

3. **Thread Management**:
   - Save `thread_ts` from first message
   - Use saved `thread_ts` for all replies
   - Thread ID is persistent across sessions

## Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Check your token permissions
python check_permissions.py

# Test text threading only
python test_thread_only.py

# Test image uploads (moderate pace)
python test_image_moderate.py
```

## Implementation Highlights

- Clean, simple API design
